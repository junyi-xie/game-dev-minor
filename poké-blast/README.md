# Ultimate Skilz - Game Programming | Platinum 2

.. something about defending your base from pocket monsters rushing with a blaster in 3d!

## Requirements

- Gameplay & playability  
  - The game contains gameplay in a gameplay loop. There is a way for the player to interact with the game, a goal to work towards and obstacles in their way. The game doesn't crash.
- Polish
  - You've expanded the game with nice-to-haves in the form of cool assets (no need to make them yourself), effects, tweens / juicyness, audio or other ways to elevate the experience to the next level.
- Implementation 
  - The game is not held together by duct tape, string and prayers, but is sufficiently implemented.
