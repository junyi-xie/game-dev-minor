# Implementing a State Machine in Godot - Game Programming | Gold 1

Simple Finite State Machine implementation in Godot 4.4.

## Controls

The player can be moved using the following controls:

- **WASD** or **Arrow keys** to move
- **Space** to jump
- **Space (mid-air)** to double jump (_only accessible while in Jump or Fall state_)

## Requirements

- Simple 2D/3D level.
- Player can be controlled.
- Conatains at least 4 different states.
- At least 1 state relies on another state.
- Different states should be observable.
- State machine implementation uses class-hierarchy.
- Player movement is framerate independent.
- Player is kept in frame.
